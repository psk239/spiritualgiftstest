Spiritual Gifts Test Jquery

This project is designed to allow a lightweight solution for taking a basic Christian spiritual gifts test.
The project uses a Node.js server to serve up a JSON payload of questions. These questions are parsed by a 
JQuery-powered website which prompts the user to answer the questions. 

This test is not "official" by any means, it is, however, intended for use within Christian audiences.
